# General
This is my personal blog. My current interests include statistics/econometrics, data science, surveys and polling, time series, and spatial statistics.  

The views expressed on this site are my personal views. 

# This site
My plan is to make the source code and any underlying data available when possible. You should be able to find the source code [here](https://github.com/sjwild).
