# General
I am a Principal Analyst at the [Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/). My current interests include household finance, banking, economics, statistics/econometrics, data science, surveys and polling, time series, and spatial statistics.  

The views expressed on this site are my own. 

# This site
My plan is to make the source code and any underlying data available when possible. You should be able to find the source code [here](https://github.com/sjwild).
