# General
I am a Senior Research and Policy Officer at the [Financial Consumer Agency of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency.html). My current interests include household finance, banking, economics, statistics/econometrics, data science, surveys and polling, time series, and spatial statistics.  

The views expressed on this site are my own. 

# This site
My plan is to make the source code and any underlying data available when possible. You should be able to find the source code [here](https://github.com/sjwild).
