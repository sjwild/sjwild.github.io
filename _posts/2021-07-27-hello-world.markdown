# Hello, world!
If you search Google for a list of blogs related topics like statistics/econometrics, data science, surveys, R, Python, julia, you will find thousands. So do we need another blog devoted to these topics? No. Is that going to stop me from blogging about those topics? Also no.

# What this blog is about
This is a (mostly) technically-oriented blog about topics that interest me, such as spatial statistics, survey analysis, polling, time series, and other statistics/econometrics topics. My goal are to:

* teach myself some new things  
* after many painful hours teaching myself new things, share them with others so that they can hopefully avoid the same problems  
* learn about topics and issues affecting Canada, and sources of data for examining them  
* highlight sources of data that can be applied to real problems  

In the spirit of openness--and to get feedback--I intend to make the source code and any underlying data available when possible. You should be able to find the source code [here](https://github.com/sjwild). I will share data where possible. If I can't share it (e.g., because of licence restrictions), I will point you to the source.

Except for my next post about election forecasting, I have no real plans for future posts. So this blog will be updated approximately "whenever I feel like it".
