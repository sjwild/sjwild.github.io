This is my estimate of Canadian vote intention based on polls listed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_45th_Canadian_federal_election). The predictions for voting intention assume that the polling errors are the same both pre- and post- 2021 election. That may or may not be true, but I suspect that polling errors are correlated between these periods.

Using polls up to and including December 12, 2021, the LPC maintains a slight lead. Estimated vote intention for December 12th was:
