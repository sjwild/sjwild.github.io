# Resources
Below are some resources that I have found helpful. I've recommended them often, so I thought I would put them together in one place. I have given preference to free resources on the internet. Some are videos, some books, some articles or websites. Generally, I've focused on courses or books at the expense of other things. That said, there are a few books listed below, even if they aren't free.

## Intro
Coming soon.

## Intermediate
Coming soon.

## Advanced
